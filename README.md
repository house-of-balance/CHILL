# What is "DR. NOPE"?
Wondering what "DR. NOPE" is and who they are?
Well DR. NOPE is a public discord bot coded by Zₐₗgₒ#8436 with ideas from !?BRANDGRAND?!#3001.
# Self Hosting
Wanna host the bot yourself? Well nobody's stopping you!

Step 1. Install <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/">node.js</a> and install discord.js with `npm install discord.js`

Step 2. Download this repo. <a href="https://github.com/house-of-balance/DR.-NOPE/archive/master.zip">Download Link</a> 

Step 3. Edit the `config.json` to your needs.

Step 4. Extract the zip file and open a terminal where you extracted it.

Step 5. In the terminal, type `node bot.js`

If you see: "Ready!" in the terminal, that means you did it! If you got errors, try again or use the pre-hosted bot!
Note: Some bot commands are focused on the bot account, so you might wanna change some of the commands from `DR. Nope!#0908` to `Bot name and tag here`.
